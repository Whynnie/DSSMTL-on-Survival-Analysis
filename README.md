# SURVIVAL ANALYSIS USING DEEP SEMI-SUPERVISED MULTITASK LEARNING ALGORITHM

### INTRODUCTION
An important challenge in the analysis of longitudinal data is the ability to accurately forecast the period at which an event of interest will occur. The existence of instances whose event outcomes become impossible to see beyond a given point in time or when some instances go the entire monitoring period without experiencing any events is one of the primary issues in this setting. Such a process is referred to as censoring, and it can be effectively managed utilizing approaches from survival analysis. Recently, machine learning approaches have drawn a lot of interest, particularly when used to the creation of prediction models from data. Although they may have advantages over traditional statistical techniques, such as the capacity to model non-linear relationships and to build symbolic and understandable models, their applications to survival analysis are at best infrequent, primarily due to the challenge of handling censored data in an appropriate manner. In this study, we give a thorough and organized analysis of the representative statistical techniques applied to survival analysis, and we present a schema for multitask learning in the realm of survival analysis using deep learning approach. The later was applied to four real life data and the performance of the model were compared against the classical methods using C-index and Integrated briers score. The results on the four data sets revealed an improvement in prediction accuracy with deep learning method over the classical methods. Finally, the most associated variables were selected across the real life data and plotted on the variable important chart. This study aims to formulate the survival analysis problem as a multi-task learning problem and apply a deep semisupervised multitask learning algorithms on time to event dataset.
